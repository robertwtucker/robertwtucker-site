title: Better Late Than Never
---

As this site nears its first birthday, I figure it's time for an update. Some actual content might be nice, too! Yeah, this site has been up almost a year and I have yet to post anything. :scream:

For some reason, I find writing difficult. I can't decide if it's because:
- I can't imagine anyone wanting to read about the things I'm doing or that I'm interested in (<em>Boring! Nerdy!</em> I imagine people saying),
- I don't think I'm good at it so I get into an endless edit-cycle trying to improve (read: perfect) what I've written, or
- I truly just don't like it.

Either way, I've decided it's important both personally and professionally to find my voice as a writer. Not only that, but I need a sample post to check styles and formatting with so I can launch the new site layout. So, I'm just going to go with it see where this post leads me...

### Let's light this candle :birthday:

First things first &ndash; I'm not making "write more" a New Year's resolution. That's the quickest way I know to make sure something <em>doesn't</em> happen. Since this is a self-improvement challenge I'm going to tackle it like other self-improvement challenges I've undertaken. I've found success usually comes through repetition. Repetition becomes habit, habit leads to results and results, well, you get the idea.

The key will be finding the triggers that will lead to writing. I don't have an answer for that yet so I can't say how often I'll be posting new content. After all, `writing != publishing`. I can, however, say that I envision this blog as a place to write about projects I'm working on. In particular, I'd like to showcase:
- The things I've learned and some of the thinking behind decisions made along the way
- Code-snippets that others might find useful
- Other things as I find them that I can contribute back to the open-source community from which I have learned so much.

So, based on that, keep an eye on this space and I hope you enjoy the things I choose to share!
