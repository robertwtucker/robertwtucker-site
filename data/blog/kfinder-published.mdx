Earlier this week, what I have sometimes referred to as my “perpetual side-
project” was finally published in the App Store. The app, named
[KFinder](https://kfinderapp.com), is designed to support two key activities
in a successful anti-coagulant therapy program involving warfarin: consistent
intake of Vitamin K and regular blood testing. The app itself isn't unique or
revolutionary. In fact, I'm not charging anything for it. I've even open-sourced
the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/robertwtucker/kfinderapp-ios).

To be totally honest, I think the reason I went ahead and pushed forward with
releasing the app at this point was so I could say I'm not just an “eclectic
developer” but a real, published one, at that. I mean, who doesn't want to
write a bunch of app code only to have to create a [website](https://kfinderapp.com)
with a privacy policy, terms of use, etc. to go with it?

I kid. I kid. It's all part of experiencing the full cycle of software
development. I wasn't kidding earlier when I used the word perpetual. I started
the project back in 2016 to support my own needs and, of course, to learn more
about software development for the iOS platform along the way. Over the years,
I've written and re-written the app using technologies like
[Swift](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/)
with [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/about_app_development_with_uikit),
[RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev)
and now [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/).

While I've already pushed the first update to Apple for review, I still consider
this an MVP. That's Minimum Viable Product for anyone reading that might not be
familiar with acronyms we use in the software biz. My mental roadmap includes
adding features like test and food tracking with some charts/graphs to go with
it. We'll have to see what my upcoming evenings and weekends allow before
committing to any sort of timeframes. Hopefully, it doesn't take another 8
years to get there…

At any rate, I'll include a link to download KFinder below. If you happen to
get it and find it useful, I'd sincerely appreciate it if you could leave a
review on the App Store. Issues, bugs and general feedback can always be posted
directly in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/robertwtucker/kfinderapp-ios/issues).
