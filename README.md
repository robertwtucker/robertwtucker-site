## Overview

This is the source repository for Robert Tucker's personal website at [https://robertwtucker.com](https://robertwtucker.com). It is:

- Coded with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) in vim-mode on a Mac.
- Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).
- Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home).

## Development

Since this repository is published directly to Vercel via their integration, there is only one long-running branch. Minor changes are generally applied directly to `master`. Larger, more complex changes are undertaken in a feature-branch before being merged with a push request.
